/* Google Fonts Import */
/* This imports all available Google Fonts */
/* Note: This approach may significantly increase load times and is not recommended for production use */
/* For production, it's better to selectively import only the fonts you need */

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat');

/* 
   The empty family parameter in the URL above tells Google Fonts to include all available fonts.
   This is the simplest way to import all Google Fonts using only CSS.
   
   However, please be aware that this will try to load all Google Fonts, which can be thousands of fonts.
   This can significantly slow down your website and is not recommended for actual use.
   
   For a real project, you should only import the specific fonts you need, like this:
   @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500;700&family=Open+Sans:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap');
