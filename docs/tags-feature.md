# Question Tags Feature Documentation

## Overview
The tags feature allows administrators to categorize questions using descriptive tags. These tags will enable filtering and organization of questions in future implementations.

## Usage

### Adding Tags
1. When creating or editing a question, locate the "Tags" field in the form
2. Enter one or more tags separated by commas
3. Example: "math, algebra, equations"

### Tag Guidelines
- Tags must be alphanumeric (letters and numbers only)
- Spaces are allowed within tags
- Tags are automatically converted to lowercase
- Invalid characters will cause validation errors
- Empty tags are automatically filtered out

### Technical Details
- Tags are stored as an array in the question data structure
- Each tag is normalized (converted to lowercase, trimmed)
- Tags are validated using a regular expression pattern: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/`
- The system will reject any tags containing special characters

### Future Features
The tags system is designed to support:
- Question filtering by tag
- Tag-based search
- Tag suggestions
- Tag statistics and analytics

## Implementation Notes
- Tags are stored alongside other question data in the database
- Front-end validation ensures data quality
- Tags are indexed for efficient searching
